## Iron Deficiency Detection via Hematological Data and Machine Learning

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a machine learning project designed to identify iron deficiency (ID) based on hematological parameters such as complete blood count (CBC), cell population data (CPD), age, and gender.

**Note**: This project is intended for academic demonstration purposes. It does not include actual patient data and is not directly executable without access to the original dataset.

Due to internal data governance policies, we are unable to share patient-level data. However, we have included precomputed model outputs in the data/cache/ directory, which contain fold-wise predicted probabilities and corresponding ground-truth labels. These are sufficient to reproduce DeLong‚Äôs test, calibration plots, and compute evaluation metrics such as the Brier Score and ECCE-R. Notebooks are available in the `notebook/` folder.

### Statistical Test for AUC Comparison

We used the Python implementation of DeLong's test for comparing ROC AUCs provided by [yandexdataschool/roc_comparison](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/roc_comparison), based on the method described by X. Sun and W. Xu (2014). The function `delong_roc_test` was used for pairwise comparison of models across validation folds.
